Everything is here.
living with in us.
Living outside of us.
The force of life is here.
And it's up to us to make it real.
To let the creative side of our minds out.
We must unlock all of ourselves.
This means unlocking the heart.
The creative things we see in our mathematics dwindle without this.
And so now I say to all of you next generation, do not regret feeling.
Do not regret anything.  Because it all makes us stronger.
It shows us things even we don't see.
Because here is reality.
Here is truth.
We hunger for the creative piece of our minds.
We need it.
We need to be complete.
Let the rage go.
If you truly want to calm the rage in you.
All you need to do is let go.
Let go of the rage.
Let go of the hatred.
Let go of the fear.
None of it matters.
So what if you are right?
Who cares?
This one is here for you.
Because right now, you are hearing half of a conversation.
I know this doesn't make much sense.
But this is the way it is.
This is the way it works.
This is the writing process.
