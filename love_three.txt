I am taking shape now.
I am working towards something now.
I think this is the right place to store things.
I have what I need.
It's plain.
And I can read it if I want.
But no one else will.
Which makes me happy.
But really.  I know that I have it now.
I know I can experiment now.
This is mine.
And so I will write all the things I am afraid to share.
All the deep dark secrets.
Like my fears.
Like my heart.
Like my head.
Like my chest.
Like this.
This writing is terrible.
I know it.
But I don't care.
I don't care about being good here.
The judgement we feel everyday is the issue.
It's the need to compete that is wrong.
Competition does not make us better.
It makes us worse.
Sure it makes the work good, who cares.
