It's time for my deepest secrets to come clear.
It's time for me to be what I am.
It's time for reality.
It's time for honesty.
It's time for me to be an adult.
I fully fledged.
I real human.

I used to write so well.
So what happened?
I put in my 10,000 hours.
But I lost it.
I think the 10,000 hours rule is wrong.

In fact, I think the right rule is 10,000 hours of initial investment.
And then there is some continual investment that must persist.
Otherwise the skill suffers.
The neurological connections fade.
And you lose your 10,000 hours.
But the question is what is the optimal state?  What is the decay rate?
And if we could determine it, then we could maintain the maximal set of 
skills.
Then we could reach completion.  Be a tripple threat.
But a quadrupple threat.
Then the work would not suffer.  But the question is, what is the 
optimal point?
The question matters, for two reasons:

First, if you do something too much, your brain becomes too efficient at
this one thing, and then the synthesis of other tasks becomes more difficult.
Ultimately leading to reduced brain function.

Second, if you do this too little, you do not gain mastery and thus your brain
never learns to make tasks efficient.  Thus you are forever not performing
to your potential.

Thus the best way, is the balanced way.  Between maintanience and new tasks.
However, there must be an element of surprise.  Of change.  If you become too patterned,
you will fall into the same situation you did before.  Which is bad.

So there must be some degree of randomness, regardless.  Which makes planning difficult.
But still necessary.
