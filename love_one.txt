This is where my writing will be stored.  
This is where I will leave my heart for you to find it.
You found it once.
You knew it because it was mine.
You knew it because it was yours.
This is our secret to keep.
I love you.
Three little words with power and strength.
Three little words that bind us for all time.
Sometimes I think of you still.
Even though you are gone.
And I pray the world can read the sadness in my eyes.
A mark that you are gone.
I will send this message out.
Because I still love you.
Broken as I am.
I know it's not normal.
I don't care.
I will never choose.
Because I love you.
Forever.
