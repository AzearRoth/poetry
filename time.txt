Well, now it is real.  Now everything is the way it was.  But things are finally moving on.
So we hope to be okay.  We hope to be fine.  But we aren't.  We are lonely.  It's 3 am and there is nothing I can do.
I wish I wasn't naked.  And so I am okay.  What are you doing.  But that's the way it is.  I am in it now.  But I won't be for long.
I'm going to be okay.
