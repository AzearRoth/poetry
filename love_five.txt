Perhaps these are weird.  I'm sure whoever likes this must be weird.
I don't want to know them. I don't want to know anything.  I just want to
be gone.  I want to be away.  Maybe I should just leave.  I feel like a kid again.
I know that's weird, but still I do.  No one who reads this will understand me.
Because this isn't the real me.  This is the crazy me.  I am nuts.  It's true.  I'm mentally unstable.
It's just a fact.  I'm crazy.  I'm not brilliant.  I'm insane.  And that's all.  
There is nothing special about me.  About what I'm trying to do with my life, about who I am.
The only thing I know is that I am nuts.  And that's it.  I'm a loser.  I'm a freak.  I always have been.
And now it's finally all coming together.  I am making things worse.  I am full of hate.
And so that's the way it is.  I don't know what else to do.  I am the worst.  I am disgusting.  Filled with self hate.
I understand what to do.  I understand what I am.  But this is the emptiness I feel.  What is the thing.
What is the real thing?  I study time.  That was what it was.  I study time.  That's the missing piece.  Sure, the movie is weird.
But only so, weird.  In fact, it's just meant to be less boring.  There is a pretty clear story.  So that's it.  I understand it now.
I guess it might be hard to follow for some people.  People who don't care, because it's not clear.  It's tough to say if stuff like that will work.
It did this time.  It was anna.  At least for him.  But not for me.  For me, it's nothing like that.  For me, it's never going to happen.
For me it's not possible.  For me, nothing will happen.  For me it will never happen.  I will never have love agian.  I should inspect this later.
It's weird when you just let your writing out.  When you don't have to worry about convention or style because it's all a part of you.
This is what makes things the way they are.  This is what makes everything work the way it does.  I guess. I don't know any more.  I feel much stronger now.
I feel much better.  19 lines.  That's what this truly takes.  19 lines of code.  Of words.  To write thousands of lines.  That is my goal.  I must.
I must be strong.  I must be stronger.  I must understand what it is others fail to grasp.  I must make the real choices.  I must be stronger.  
There are a lot of smart people working on this.  But the glory goes to those who are right.  I will be right.  Do you know how I will be right?
It's actually quiet simple.  I wil use my strength of will.  I will use what other people don't have.  I will use what I must.  I will use the one thing,
that gives me an advantage.  I am both ways.  I am the creative soul and the cold mathematical intellect.  I am both ways.  And they say I must choose.
That I must be efficient in one way.  But here is the other thing.  I don't have to choose.  Do you know why?  Because I've put in the 10,000 hours on both.
I am all the skills in both hemispheres.  So I don't have to choose.  In fact, I run less efficiently when I choose.  I am the super mind.  I am the waiting thing.
And so I will use this double 10,000 hours to make the choices.  To be the thing they aren't.  I am the 20,000 hours.  
But ther eis a reason for this.  It's because I don't have friends.  Because I have no one to love.  I have sacrificed the greatest part of humanity.
I have sacrificed love, for this gift.  I will never have love now.  Because no one else puts in the time.  No one else short of a fall victim.
And then, even then, they aren't really ready.  And so I give.  I accept.  I will be alone.  Because no one my age cares.  They've all caught up.
And some of them have gone further.  So what do I do?  I am behind now.  It's going to be okay.  I just have to get a little further.  I just have to climb a little higher.
And then I will be alone forever.
